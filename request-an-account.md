# Request an Account

## UAF Affiliated Researcher

As an existing UAF Affiliated Researcher (a UAF faculty, staff, or student with an **ACTIVE** UA Identity / Username), simply fill out the form on our website, listed [HERE](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/form/user-account-application-rcs-). This will generate a form to be signed by both the UAF Principal Investigator and the user to be added to our systems. We will then process the ticket and provision the requested account.

## Sponsored User or expired UA Identity

In order to use the form above, you must have an active UA Identity and be a current UAF member/affiliate. If both of these conditions do not apply, you must request a sponsored UA Identity from the UAF Registrar or reactivate a previous one. Due to the complexity of creating UA Identities through the UA System workflow, we now provide the forms directly to UAF Faculty, Staff, and Sponsored Users.&#x20;

To request an account, either the sponsoring Faculty or sponsored User will need to complete the following forms in this order:

1. Request a UA User Account be generated from the UAF Registrar. [Affiliate Identity Request - Non-UA Login](https://dynamicforms.ngwebsolutions.com/Submit/Form/Start/78a2640e-f87a-4a67-b8ec-6ddd30608e30) (Sponsored User Form)
2. Submit[ a ticket with OIT to provision permissions on the new account](https://service.alaska.edu/TDClient/39/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=5Byah%7eerQ9E\_\&RequestorType=ServiceOffering)
3. Submit a request for an [RCS User Account](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/form/user-account-application-rcs-). This will create a ticket in our system.

After all these tasks have been completed, the new account will be established and active on the services requested.
