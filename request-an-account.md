# Request an Account

## UAF Affiliated Researcher

As an existing UAF Affiliated Researcher (a UAF faculty, staff, or student with an **ACTIVE** UA Identity / Username), the Sponsoring Faculty must fill out the form on our website, listed [HERE](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/form/user-account-application-rcs-). We will then process the ticket and provision the requested account.

Please be advised that in order to add the Sponsored User to an associated project, the PI must either submit this form itself, or directly approve adding them to the project.

## Sponsored Researcher (non-affiliated)

A Sponsored Researcher (an external non-UA associate with **NO UA IDENTITY** or an **INACTIVE** (previous) UA Identity / Username) requires official sponsorship from an existing UAF Affiliated Researcher (Faculty only).&#x20;

Please read the section below on how to create request accounts.

## How to request a Sponsored Researcher Account



In order to use the form above, you must have an active UA Identity and be a current UAF member/affiliate. If both of these conditions do not apply, you must request a sponsored UA Identity from the UAF Registrar or reactivate a previous UA ID. Due to the complexity of creating UA Identities through the UA System workflow, we now provide the forms directly to Sponsoring Faculty to complete.

To request an account, the Sponsoring Faculty will need to complete the following forms in this order:

1. Request a UA User Account be generated from the UAF Registrar: [Affiliate Identity Request (Sponsored User Form)](https://nextgensso.com/sp/startSSO.ping?PartnerIdpId=urn:mace:incommon:alaska.edu\&TargetResource=https://dynamicforms.ngwebsolutions.com/Submit/Form/Start/78a2640e-f87a-4a67-b8ec-6ddd30608e30)
2. Submit a ticket with OIT to configure the new account: [Existing Account Help - Modify Account Access](https://service.alaska.edu/TDClient/39/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=PYp7B91BWaE\_\&RequestorType=ServiceOffering\&SIDs=130)
   * Have the Sponsored User set their UA Account Password by hitting the "Forgot Password" link on OIT's website once OIT completes your request: [ELMO - Easy Login Maintenance Option](https://elmo.alaska.edu/)
   * If they run into issues using this service, please have them contact OIT directly at [907-450-8300](tel:907-370-3015)
3. Submit a request for an RCS User Account: [RCS User Account Application](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/form/user-account-application-rcs-)

Once these steps are completed, they will be able to log into the UA VPN and all assigned RCS systems. If you have any questions, please contact us at [uaf-rcs@alaska.edu ](<mailto:uaf-rcs@alaska.edu >)or [907-450-8602](tel:907-450-8602).

{% hint style="info" %}
After all these tasks have been completed, the new account will be established and active on the services requested.
