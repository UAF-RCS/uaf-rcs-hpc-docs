# Using the Batch System

The [SLURM](https://www.schedmd.com/) \(Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management\) workload manager is a software package for submitting, scheduling, and monitoring jobs on large compute clusters. SLURM is available on Chinook for submitting and monitoring user jobs.

Similar to PBS/TORQUE, SLURM accepts user jobs specified in batch scripts. More information on SLURM batch scripts may be found below.

Common SLURM commands, SLURM batch scripts, translating from PBS/TORQUE to SLURM, and running interactive jobs are discussed below. SchedMD, the company behind SLURM, has also put together a [quick reference for SLURM commands](https://slurm.schedmd.com/pdfs/summary.pdf).
