# Installing Your Own Software



Individuals and research groups may install third party applications and libraries for their own use in the following locations:

* [$HOME](../available-filesystems/available-filesystems.md#home)
* `/usr/local/unsupported`

Packages built for personal use only should be installed in $HOME.

The `/usr/local/unsupported` directory is intended to host user-installed and maintained software packages and datasets that are shared with a group of users on the system. Users who add content to `/usr/local/unsupported` are fully responsible for the maintenance of the files and software versions. Please read the `/usr/local/unsupported/README.RCS` file for more information.

To request a new subdirectory within `/usr/local/unsupported`, please contact RCS with the following information:

* The name of the requested subdirectory, which can be your project's name \(e.g., UAFCLMIT\) or the type of software you intend to install in the directory \(e.g., "ClimateModels"\)
* A general description of what you intend to install
* A rough estimate of the amount of storage you will need \(e.g., 100 MB\)
